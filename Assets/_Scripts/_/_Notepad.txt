- Have enemies NOT reappear at the top of the screen after player dies
- Blend torso and legs player animations so the legs keep running when player attacks
- custom inspector for DestoryOrDisable to show variables only if corresponding bools are ticked (article)
- Import object pooling asset? (write article about it)
- Make sure player can only open the treasure chest with melee
- stamina boost powerup instantly completes cooldown

[CORE PROGRAMMING]

"Smart Enemy"
♦ enemy that fires a net when the player is behind her
♦ net moves pretty slowly
♦ if this net hits player, their movement is halted for a couple seconds

"Enemy Pickup Behavior"
- pickups move slower than enemies
- if enemey detects pickup close to them, they attack it (but prioritize attacking player)
- pickups will be destroyed in 2 hits from enemies

"Pickup Collect"
- if player is close enough to pickup, they can press 'C' to 'magnetize' pickup to them
- visual indicator for when player is close enough to do this
- player uses harpoon-whip to grab it
- harpoon whip has a cooldown, indicated on the HUD

"Enemy Avoid Shot"
- enemy that holds a shield
- this enemy blocks all melee attacks
- player must use ranged attacks to hit them
OR
- enemy that is very quick
- dodges all ranged attacks
- player can only hit the enemy with melee attacks

"Homing Projectile"
- rare powerup that give player homing boomerang
- boomerang returns to player after hitting enemy, or if there are no enemies to hit, after a certain distance
- boomerang cracks with each enemy hit, disappearing after 5 hits (and after a timer?)

"Boss AI"
- waves culminate into a final boss wave
- boss moves to the center of the screen and throws many ninja stars with unique attacks
- boss health bar



Final update:
- improve dodge mechanic (make it last longer)
