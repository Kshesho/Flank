cur - 
[Framework - 'Shield Strength'] player now gets up to 3 shields that rotate around them; fixed (possibly temporarily) UI elements anchored to the corner moving when the project is closed and reopened

last - 
[Framework - 'Thruster: Scaling Bar UI'] changed 'dodge cooldown' powerup to 'stamina boost' powerup that increases stamina fill rate. Also added new sprite for stamina boost powerup; Added 8-directional animations for dodge, walk, and run; added dodge and stamina boost icons on the HUD; fixed a bug where stamina would drain even if the player isn't moving; 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: 
- Implement melee attack for enemy
- BUG: player doesn't start sprinting when holding shift when the stamina cooldown ends
- Have enemies NOT reappear at the top of the screen after player dies
- Blend torso and legs player animations so the legs keep running when player attacks
- custom inspector for DestoryOrDisable to show variables only if corresponding bools are ticked (article)
- Import object pooling asset? (write article about it)
