last - 
Huntress complete. She now gets damaged and spawns

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: 
- player actually attacks in the direction they're facing
- Implement melee attack for enemy
- BUG: player doesn't start sprinting when holding shift when the stamina cooldown ends
- Have enemies NOT reappear at the top of the screen after player dies
- Blend torso and legs player animations so the legs keep running when player attacks
- custom inspector for DestoryOrDisable to show variables only if corresponding bools are ticked (article)
- Import object pooling asset? (write article about it)
- Make sure player can only open the treasure chest with melee
- stamina boost powerup instantly completes cooldown


COLLISION
