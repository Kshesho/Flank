COLLISION
Offensive collisions - things that do damage handle OnTriggerEnter and call OnCollision, giving it a damage amount
things taking damage subscribe to OnCollision when they're enabled
*Exception: The boss detects player's weapons and handles collisions, due to need for special functionality.
