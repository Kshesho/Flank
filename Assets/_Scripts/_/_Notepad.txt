[CORE PROGRAMMING - 'Pickup Collect'] Player can now magnetize powerups towards them by holding C; BUG - UI became broken again. Completely gone... sigh. 

last - 
[CORE PROGRAMMING - 'Enemy Pickup Behavior'] Vigilantes now attack powerups if they are close to them when attacking

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: 
- player actually attacks in the direction they're facing
- Implement melee attack for enemy
- BUG: player doesn't start sprinting when holding shift when the stamina cooldown ends
- Have enemies NOT reappear at the top of the screen after player dies
- Blend torso and legs player animations so the legs keep running when player attacks
- custom inspector for DestoryOrDisable to show variables only if corresponding bools are ticked (article)
- Import object pooling asset? (write article about it)
- Make sure player can only open the treasure chest with melee
- stamina boost powerup instantly completes cooldown

[CORE PROGRAMMING]

"Pickup Collect"
♦ while C is held, visual indicator of range shows
♦ powerups in this range move towards player

"Enemy Avoid Shot"
- enemy that holds a shield
- this enemy blocks all melee attacks
- player must use ranged attacks to hit them
OR
- enemy that is very quick
- dodges all ranged attacks
- player can only hit the enemy with melee attacks

"Homing Projectile"
- rare powerup that give player homing boomerang
- boomerang returns to player after hitting enemy, or if there are no enemies to hit, after a certain distance
- boomerang cracks with each enemy hit, disappearing after 5 hits (and after a timer?)

"Boss AI"
- waves culminate into a final boss wave
- boss moves to the center of the screen and throws many ninja stars with unique attacks
- boss health bar



Final update:
- improve dodge mechanic (make it last longer)
