- Have enemies NOT reappear at the top of the screen after player dies
- Blend torso and legs player animations so the legs keep running when player attacks
- custom inspector for DestoryOrDisable to show variables only if corresponding bools are ticked (article)
- Import object pooling asset? (write article about it)
- Make sure player can only open the treasure chest with melee
- stamina boost powerup instantly completes cooldown

things taking damage subscribe to OnCollision when they're enabled

[CORE PROGRAMMING]

"New Enemy Movement"
- enemies sometimes move diagonally, changing directions if they hit the edge of the screen or move a certain distance

"Wave System"
- several enemies are spawned in quick succession
- next wave starts when last enemy from current wave is killed, or wave timer expiers (so player can't farm powerups)

"Negative Powerup"
- broken potion that damages player
- something that slows player movement
- debuff icon for slowing

"New Enemy Type"
- moves, then stops and fires at player
- fires a shotgun-like volley after a short chargeup

"Balanced Spawning"
- revamp spawning with a weight table
- determine which things need to be spawned together, and which spawn independently
- ammo is frequent & health is rare

"Enemy Shields"
- After a certain number of waves, some enemies (or new enemy) spawn with shields that give them 1 extra hit
- no matter how much damage the player does, these enemies can take at least 2 hits

"Aggressive Enemy Type"
- enemies will swing swords or try and ram the player if player gets too close
- short 'tell' before they hit the player, giving player time to dodge

"Smart Enemy"
- enemy that fires a net when behind the player
- net moves pretty slowly
- if this net hits player, they're movement is halted, and they have to rapidly press a button to break free

"Enemy Pickup Behavior"
- pickups move slower than enemies
- if enemey detects pickup close to them, they attack it (but prioritize attacking player)
- pickups will be destroyed in 2 hits from enemies

"Pickup Collect"
- if player is close enough to pickup, they can press 'C' to 'magnetize' pickup to them
- visual indicator for when player is close enough to do this
- player uses harpoon-whip to grab it
- harpoon whip has a cooldown, indicated on the HUD

"Enemy Avoid Shot"
- enemy that holds a shield
- this enemy blocks all melee attacks
- player must use ranged attacks to hit them
OR
- enemy that is very quick
- dodges all ranged attacks
- player can only hit the enemy with melee attacks

"Homing Projectile"
- rare powerup that give player homing boomerang
- boomerang returns to player after hitting enemy, or if there are no enemies to hit, after a certain distance
- boomerang cracks with each enemy hit, disappearing after 5 hits (and after a timer?)

"Boss AI"
- waves culminate into a final boss wave
- boss moves to the center of the screen and throws many ninja stars with unique attacks
- boss health bar
