boss spawns after wave 10, wave number changes to skull, and timer gets cancelled on wave 10; Powerups spawn while boss is summoning; Javelin works on boss; Set up endgame. Random enemies spawn after the boss with increasing spawn rate that's reflected on HUD; Fixed: boss would go back into attacking state if it was killed while on summoning cooldown

- Import object pooling asset? (write article about it)
- Make sure player can only open the treasure chest with melee
- stamina boost powerup instantly completes cooldown
- boomerang ammo on HUD


COLLISION
Offensive collisions - things that do damage handle OnTriggerEnter and call OnCollision, giving it a damage amount
things taking damage subscribe to OnCollision when they're enabled
*Exception: The boss detects player's weapons and handles collisions, due to need for special functionality.
