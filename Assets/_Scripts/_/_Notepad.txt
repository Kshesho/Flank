COMMIT
cur - boss transitions from summoning back to attacking, blocks, gets damaged, has a health bar, and dies now; got rid of water on tile pallet; Fixed: zombie non-trigger collider was interacting with player collider

last - 
boss now attacks, spawns zombies, and most states are set up. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: 
- player actually attacks in the direction they're facing
- Implement melee attack for enemy
- BUG: player doesn't start sprinting when holding shift when the stamina cooldown ends
- Have enemies NOT reappear at the top of the screen after player dies
- Blend torso and legs player animations so the legs keep running when player attacks
- custom inspector for DestoryOrDisable to show variables only if corresponding bools are ticked (article)
- Import object pooling asset? (write article about it)
- Make sure player can only open the treasure chest with melee
- stamina boost powerup instantly completes cooldown
- boomerang ammo on HUD


COLLISION
Offensive collisions - things that do damage handle OnTriggerEnter and call OnCollision, giving it a damage amount
things taking damage subscribe to OnCollision when they're enabled
*Exception: The boss detects player's weapons and handles collisions, due to need for special functionality.
